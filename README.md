###V-DNS blockchain system

V-DNS blockchain will provide registration, deletion, lookup and transfer of domain names. These services will take the form of smart contracts deployed within V-DNS blockchain. Smart contracts run on the V-DNS blockchain's Voiceweb Virtual Machine (VVM). V-DNS blockchain also provides mining capabilities and automatic issuance of Voicecoin
Due to the low real-time registration requirement of the domain name system, the requirements for reliability are high, we therefore employ the common mechanism of PoW to implement the contract and assist in the domain name check. As to the currency issuance mechanism: 

##	HUMAN-MEANINGFUL
 Wilcox-O’Hearn proposes the following three properties for naming protocols: human-meaningful, decentralized, and secure. V-DNS possesses the characteristics of all these and more, owing to the integration of voice features combined with blockchain technology. Human-meaningful is a common domain name system, it is user-selected and easy to remember. VNS accomplishes this, being easily recognized by the ear, unambiguous, and suitable for use on the voice Internet. Voiceweb’s primary feature is voice. The design of voice domain name rules is not on the state’s constant suffix, but in the form of dialogue with people. The actual situation is that the traditional top-level domain names are gradually coming out with more natural language features, but the development is very slow. Adding a gTLD (Generic Top-Level Domain) is troublesome. In addition to the technical issues of efficiency and scalability, NAMECOIN only supports .bit suffixes in product features, and does not support other suffixes. Extended support for the domain name is poor, and scalability is poor. For example, it does not support Txt records. Blockstack is a virtual chain implementing an abstract state machine that works on other blockchain platforms. State machines are used to perform a variety of services, including the identity service OneName, which in theory can execute any service. Solving part of NAMECOIN’s technology issues, there are many others that allow users to own their own data, but they do not support a natural language domain name.

##	CONVENIENT
Voicecoin provides an intimate and natural interface between human and computer while reducing the cost of interactions. Voice, as a natural method of login and payment, serves as a core factor permeating the entirety of the voice Blockchain. Voicecoin, the voice Blockchain, and its peripheral products, is the main distinguishing factor from other currencies and services. Voicecoin, will allow people to trade domain names. People can pay for any service on any accessible voice blockchain using VoiceCoin. When not logged-in, you can utilize the chatbot services. When logged-in, you can take it a step further, and even initiate payment via the chatbot. This product was designed to utilize the distinguishing characteristic of speech, from wallet authentication and login to the registration of domain names, and even the provision of chat services. Using voice, people can log in to the wallet; using the voice wallet, people can register the voice featured domain name. Using Voicecoin, people can chat with chatbots
over speech-enabled devices.

##	DECENTRALIZATION
Traditional VNS is based on ICANN, but VNS is completely different; it runs on a decentralized blockchain. It can be executed by anyone, but cannot be controlled by anyone. Each node runs independently and does not depend on any third-party services.

##	SECURITY
Under the traditional VNS mechanism, HTTPS protocols are used to solve the problem of VNS hijacking. However, the website needs to rely on the certificate authority’s guarantee (the “CA”). If any one of the thousands of CAs is attacked, makes a mistake, or is forced by a government, it may issue false certificates / credentials. Decentralized VNS does not need to rely on CA, and nobody can easily hijack VNS domain names. Traditional VNS is very weak; if a node is attacked, then there could be domain name resolution accidents. In some areas, domain name registration is subject to real name authentication, and for domain name offering services, you must first pass a governmental examination. 
V-DNS Cache Pollution often directs users to different addresses. A DDoS attack occurred in 2016 against VNS provider Dyn, rendering companies such as Amazon, Paypal, Reddit and GitHub unable to provide normal services.

##	CENSORSHIP-RESISTANT
With traditional VNS, the government can block certain website’s accessibility, but this is not done so easily with 
V-DNS. In some areas of the world, including China, websites are often not accessible due to government censorship. But VNS is built on Blockchain technology, and every domain  When the developer sets the application name, it can be analyzed via semantics name is accessible the user’s computer without tampering.

##	PRIVACY PROTECTION
Under traditional DNS, based upon the consumer’s IP address, the VNS server can track the consumer’s activity / history. A Blockchain-based domain name system, like VNS, avoids this by not producing any network tracking when users visit a site.

##	LIGHTNING-FAST
Traditional domain name switchover generally requires 24 to 48 hours, which results in unnecessary service downtime. But Blockchain based VNS can very quickly update the domain name list. Traditional VNS resolution time is slow, generally over 100 milliseconds. The VNS maintains its domain name list locally, and thus resolution time is less than 3 milliseconds.

##	SUPPORTS ANONYMITY
VNS can direct users to anonymous hosted Web sites on Tor and I2P anonymous networks. Unlike Tor’s
.onion domain (made up of random letters and numbers) or I2p’s .i2p domain, which can direct different
crowds across different websites), VNS provides both Tor and I2P hosting with suitable, readable, and
definitive VNS analyzation service. 

##	RESOURCES RELEASED
VNS establishes a process that allows people to fully release their domain name resources.

##	INTEROPERABILITY
When sharing the same basic form of domain name, global chatbots will be able to communicate with each other across platforms. For example, the traditional WeChat public number can’t talk to Facebook’s chatbot, but VNS breaks this limitation.

##	RESOURCE SHARING
By removing the individual, stand-alone domain name systems of the smart speaker manufacturers, we establish a unified domain name system which strengthens information sharing and reduce the number of intermediaries involved in consumer use of the product. This results in enhanced resource efficiency within the industry and huge improvements to the consumer’s experience.

##	OPEN-SOURCE
The VNS software is an open source project under Voiceweb. The proliferation of Namecoin is not very active, making it difficult for this platform to become a widely used and supported domain name system in decentralized Internet. VNS will effectively solve this issue. In addition to its open source code, VNS is also ecologically open source. It is not a matter of what we as individuals want within the broader ecology, we must refrain from that; we must hand over to or invest in this open ecology. For the specific technical properties and means of implementation, please refer to the technical white paper.
